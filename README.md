# weather_forecast_trier

## Project overview
In this project I wanted to investigate the weather of my hometown Trier in Germany, because my basement together with many others was flooded two times in the last two years due to heavy rainfall. This was a good opportunity to apply forecasting methods for time series analysis and better understand the difference between classical methods and deep learning. The compared methods will be ARIMA and LSTM. The monthly cumulated rainfall and average temperature are investigated.

The collected data can be found on [wetterkontor](https://www.wetterkontor.de/de/wetter/deutschland/monatswerte-station.asp).
